Welcome to the game and thanks for playing!

- HOW YOU WIN -

Get a score of 21 from your cards dealt, or get a higher score than the dealer without going 'Bust'!

- HOW YOU LOSE -

Getting a score of over 21 means you're 'Bust'

- RULES OF THE GAME -
  
Place your initial bet, and wait for your first card to be dealt. Each card has a numeric value, from 2 to 10.
The Jack, Queen and King are all worth 10. An Ace can be worth either 1 or 11.
After your first card you can either 'hit' and get another card or 'stay' to keep the cards you have.
Once the dealer has gone around the table the dealer reveals their second card.
If you get a score of 21 you recieve 1 and a half times your bet.
If the dealer goes bust, any players not gone bust receive twice their bet amount.
If the dealer has a score of 16 or less they must take another card, if it's 17 or higher the dealer must stay their hand.
If the dealer doesn't go bust, any players that have a higher combined card value recieve twice their bet amount.
